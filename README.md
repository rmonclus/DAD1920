Projects of the subject Interfaces Development at CIFP CÃ©sar Manrique (Tenerife, SPAIN)

This project is a Java Swing one, designed to teach the basis of developing graphic users interfaces.

The project is formed by the following 13 packages:

1) A simple window of 640x480 pixels that kills the process when the Close button is clicked.
2) Previous window, but not resizable.
3) Previous window, with a text field, a button and a label. When the button is pressed, the label shows the content of the text field.
4) Previous window. When clicking the Close button, a dialog asks to confirm.
5) Previous window. When clicking the button, the label shows the factorial of the number contained in the text field. An exception is handled in case there are non-numerical characters
6) Previous window, with a reorganisation of the components.
7) Previous window, with a second tag, which contains the label.
8) Previous window, with a check box that enables and disables the second tag.
9) Previous window, with two grouped radio button that enable and disable the second tag.
10) Previous window, with a new label in the first tag. When writting in the text field the new label shows the factorial at the time the caret position changes. 
11) [Not implemented yet] A new app with a canvas. When moving the cursor, pixels must be coloured.
12) [Not implemented yet] Previous window. When moving the cursor, pixels are painted in red, and when dragging, in black.
13  [Not implemented yet]  A new app with a text field and a canvas. When writting numbers sepparated by a given character in the text field, a bars or line graph must be drawn in the canvas.
